Card (possibly have each individual card inherit from an abstract Card)
Deck? (or just generate a random card in the Hand at the beginning of a turn)
Player (User & Enemy)
  Tower
  Wall
  Hand (contains available Cards)
Resources (not sure whether to keep as one class or make it a container for smaller classes)
  Quarry
    Bricks
  Magic
    Gems
  Zoo
    Beasts
WinCondition
LoseCondition (maybe?)
StartCondition

Taking a turn would be a Player method
	-Start with playing a card (if the card says "play again", draw and keep turn going)
	-Draw a card
	-Check the win/lose conditions

Probably going to end up needing a Drawable interface
